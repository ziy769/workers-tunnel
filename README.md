# workers-tunnel

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/zhu327/workers-tunnel/tree/main)

Edge network tunnel implemented using Cloudflare Workers.

It is recommended to use Xray as the tunnel client.

<https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core>

Use the following rules to split traffic by file and route Cloudflare IP directly.

<https://github.com/Loyalsoldier/v2ray-rules-dat>

Due to the limitations of Cloudflare Workers, UDP proxy is not supported, and it is not possible to use proxy to connect to Cloudflare's IP addresses. It is recommended to use the following routing configuration to establish a direct connection to Cloudflare's IP addresses.

Replace the domain `your.domain.workers.dev` in the following configuration with your Cloudflare Workers domain.

Please refer to the following documentation for development and deployment.

<https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/webassembly/rust/>

**Important**: Before deployment, you need to modify the `vars` configuration in `wrangler.toml` and change `USER_ID` to your UUID.

```toml
[vars]
USER_ID = "c55ba35f-12f6-436e-a451-4ce982c4ec1c"
```

## Setup

To create a `my-project` directory using this template, run:

```sh
$ npm init cloudflare my-project workers-tunnel
# or
$ yarn create cloudflare my-project workers-tunnel
# or
$ pnpm create cloudflare my-project workers-tunnel
```

> **Note:** Each command invokes [`create-cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare) for project creation.

## Usage

This template starts you off with a `src/lib.rs` file, acting as an entrypoint for requests hitting your Worker. Feel free to add more code in this file, or create Rust modules anywhere else for this project to use.

With `wrangler`, you can build, test, and deploy your Worker with the following commands:

```sh
# run your Worker in an ideal development workflow (with a local server, file watcher & more)
$ npm run dev

# deploy your Worker globally to the Cloudflare network (update your wrangler.toml file for configuration)
$ npm run deploy
```

Read the latest `worker` crate documentation here: https://docs.rs/worker

## WebAssembly

`workers-rs` (the Rust SDK for Cloudflare Workers used in this template) is meant to be executed as compiled WebAssembly, and as such so **must** all the code you write and depend upon. All crates and modules used in Rust-based Workers projects have to compile to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` triple.

Read more about this on the [`workers-rs`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs) project README.

## Issues

If you have any problems with the `worker` crate, please open an issue on the upstream project issue tracker on the [`workers-rs` repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs).
